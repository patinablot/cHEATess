Intent:

    - simple example of c# usage
    - use chess data e.g. from Lichess to show user's common moves, success rates given position data
    - graphically identify opening mistakes, potential variations

Paradigm:

    - display chessboard
    - display freq. analysis
        -- hardcode self
        -- by player
    
To Not:

    X - use forms
        ^ want to run on more platforms
    X - use web api
        ^ don't need to use this remotely
    X - use AI / generate move candidates / analyze
        ^ unnecessary for repertoire overview
    X - waste time drawing
        ^ simple table output OK at 1st


Inputs:

    * arbitrary vector of chess games
        -- limitation tbd e.g. by stopwatch
        -- default: 100
        * -- store (+ dupe detect?) stats through 1-by-1 entry
        	^ seems minimal

    X - curl from Lichess
        x -- consider API
        x -- determine format
             --- PGN
             ^ known can be exported
            x --- FEN
            x --- txt
            x --- json
        x -- determine curl variant

Outputs:
    1+ of:
        * - to console
        - as hosted repl
        - event log

Values:
    - 8x8 matrix
        -- rows: A-H ("ranks")
        -- cols: 1-8 ("files")

    - pieces vector, |6|
        -- pawn
        -- knight
        -- bishop
        -- rook
        -- queen
        -- king

    - players vector, |2|
        -- black
        -- white

Risks:
    - can't get the data
        > see: [[repair]]

    - feature set incompleteness
        > see: [[milestones]]

    - inconsistent paradigm
        > see: [[review]]
    
    X - code does not run
        X > see: [[issues]]

        ^ assume code runs.
    
    - code insufficient to accomplish intent
    - timescale failure
        X > see: [[postmortem]]

        ^ assume sufficient code
        ^ assume sufficient time


Benefits:
    - me:
        -- "I did it!"
        -- easier to play chess
        -- more interesting gameplay
        -- don't have to pay to analyze this
      * -- durable repertoire expansion
        -- improve github engagement

    - you:
        -- utility of reading
        -- fork?
        -- run on your own games

    - us:
        -- variant approach could generalize
            ^ analyze logs, test output

        -- easier to discuss similar works



Repair:
    " can't get the data "
        > enter into console
        > input plaintext of data
        >> use txt file as default, given 404

Milestones:

1:  
    - save game representations to file
    - count occurrences of position in map
    	-- sort desc

2:    
    - draw board from game sign input
    

3:
    - call chess engine on single position
    - compare order of positions used against engine
    - identify most common mistake(s) from position using engine's scalar eval


    (deferred / canceled):
    _
    X - get pieceset sprite sheet
    X - print pieces to board  
        X - generate candidate moves
        ^ unnecessary output

Review:

    
    domain = set of all lichess games
    filter: where player is me

    console read line
    console print line
    file write i/o
        ^ consider read i/o over read console line

    

Toolset:

    - vs code?
        ^ known easy install lang. support
    - github
        ^ also easy, try gh auth
    - vim
        ^ this readme

        ^ not configured for coding this project
        ^^ imprudent to reconfigure

    x - git issues
    	^ could rearticulate using this later - don't want to interact with right now
    x - branches, merge commits
        ^ simple enough that I don't want to overarticulate further
        ^ shouldn't need multiple branches
